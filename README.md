# RoomEditorWeb

Cloud-based 2D round-trip real-time Revit BIM room editor for any desktop or mobile device.

RoomEditorWeb is a node.js web server driving a MongoDB database storing data from Revit BIM models, levels, rooms, family symbols, furniture and equipment family instances.

It interacts with the [RoomEditorApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp) Revit add-in, which implements a C# REST client to feed the database and retrieve updated furniture locations.

Node.js web server, mongo database and user interface.
